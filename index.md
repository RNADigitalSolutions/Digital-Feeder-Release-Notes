### New features

- Simplification: bounding box, cylinder & sphere.
	- Auto-selection of the most suitable bounding shape when simplifing the custom object.
- Inclined vibration: when an object is not rotated or rotated only around one axis, it can be set with an inclined vibration: it's only necessary to input the amplitude in the inclinde direction, the direction along the axises with be automatically calculated. (If it's not rotated, the vibration is set along the z axis.)
- Setting to automatically remove objects that are vertically positioned below a specific point during the simulation.

- Values in settings dialog are saved in Windows Registry. 
- Reset settings to default values.
- Remove the unfinished material settings from object properties dialog.

## ✨ Digital Feeder 1.1.0 
<i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> &nbsp; 07.12.2020


### **Attention**

Due to the new **Equipment** feature, **Stop** button does not work properly again, it's always a headache. Therefore it's **temporarily** disabled in this version.

### New features

- **Equipment**: **Static** und **kinematic** objects can be now added into a new/existing equipment.

![](img/equipment.png)

- **Equipment library**: An equipment in the current scenario can be added into the equipment library. The equipments in the library can be loaded into the current scenario.

![](img/equipment_library.png)

### Known issues

- Equipments in **equipment library** with the SAME NAME can cause chaos. So it's recommanded to rename an equipment before adding it into library.
- One equipment can only be added into the library ONCE.
- Equipment cannot be rotated.

### Features in todo

- Solve above issues.
- Preview in Equipment Library window.
- Rename equipment in Equipment Library.
- Drag a component out of the equipment, which it belongs.

## ✨ Digital Feeder 1.0.0
<i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> &nbsp; 22.09.2020

### **Attention**

Due to the new **transformation** function, this version may have problems loading the `dfs` file generated by the previous versions. Therefore, you may need to use this version to recreate a `dfs` file for a corresponding scene.


### New features

- **Search bar**: search objects and sources by name (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>).

![](img/searchbar.png)

- Transformation: when importing an `stl` file, user can choose to import it as a tooling or feeding part:
	- As tooling: the object can only be set to static or kinemaic,
	- As feeding part: origin of the coordinate system of the object will be moved to the center of mass.
- Source Properties: source can be parameterized now.
- Remove source, at the same time all child objects of the source will be removed as well.
- Move and rotate source from manipulator.




### Improvements

- Highlight selected source.
- Save button on tool bar.
- By source generated objects are named with number.
- Source is shown as bold and yellow in tree view, to make it more obvious.



## ✨ 02.09.2020 (incomplete version)

### New features

- 3D-window picker: selection of objects and sources from 3D-window (holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> for multiselection).
- Tree view: the objects generated from one source will be shown in a group.
- Content menu for selected objects and/or sources from tree view and 3D-window.
- **Source Properties** Dialog: the paramters of source can be shown here, and source can be also paused and restarted.
- Normal distribution for restitution and friction.
- Hide/unhide objects and sources.

### Improvements

- Adjusted icon for **Create Source** button.
- Better structure of the entire codebase.

### Incomplete features

This version is incomplete. The following features are still under heavy construction and will be done in next releases:

- **Stop** button: it does not work properly (again).
- Source is still not parameterizable from **Source Properties**.
- Source cannot be removed.
- Selected source still cannot be highlighted in 3D-window.
- By clicking on **Properties** button: 
	- when only objects are selected, the **Object Properties** dialog shows;
	- when only sources are selected, the **Source Properties** dialog shows;
	- But when both objects and sources are selected, also only the **Object Properties** dialog shows, which is wrong. (In the next release, a dialog will be shown at first, to let user choose which dialog window to be shown.)


## ✨ 19.07.2020
